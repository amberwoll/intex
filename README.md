# Turtle Shelter Project 

**We are collaborating with a non-profit organization to develop a robust data storage system for efficiently maintaining and managing their records. This organization is dedicated to supporting homeless individuals, ensuring they have the resources to stay warm during the harsh winter months. Our work spans from form normalization and designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to building a functional website and ultimately creating an interactive dashboard to streamline their operations.**
